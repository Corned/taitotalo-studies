# Taitotalo Studies

In this repository, I collect some scripts I write at Taitotalo while learning Python.

This includes:

- Advent of Code puzzles
- Simple games
- Implementations of sorting algorithms
- Other various exercises
- AI generated cheatsheets for learning Python concepts (read with caution!)

## TODO

- Fix advent of code solutions reading files
